# extended-euclidean-visual

  This is a visualization program for 
  (1) finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm,
  (2) finding the modular inverse of a number, and
  (3) using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve systems of congruences.

  The file ExtendedEuclideanVisual.jar is compatible to be run as an executable, just double click it and it should work with JRE 1.8.0_11 and later.

  Alternatively, you may run the JAR file in your terminal like any other JAR file:
  
  java -jar ExtendedEuclideanVisual.jar

  NOTE: You may need to right click the JAR file and
  -> click Properties 
  -> click Permissions 
  -> check "Allow executing file as program"

  For a detailed example of how to compute the GCD, find a modular inverse, and solve a system of congruences by hand, see < link will be put here >
