# extended-euclidean-visual

  This is a visualization program to
  (1) find the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm,
  (2) find the modular inverse of a number, and
  (3) use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve a congruence system.

  The file ExtendedEuclideanVisual.jar is compatible to be run as an executable, just double click it and it should work with JRE 1.8.0_11 and later.

  Alternatively, you may run the JAR file in your terminal like any other JAR file:
  
  java -jar ExtendedEuclideanVisual.jar

  NOTE: You may need to right click the JAR file and
  -> click Properties 
  -> click Permissions 
  -> check "Allow executing file as program"

  The Help tab includes detailed examples that explain how to compute by hand.
