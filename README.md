# extended-euclidean-visual

  This is a visualization program for 
  (1) finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and
  (2) finding the modular inverse of a number.
  
  The file ExtendedEuclideanVisual.jar is compatible to be run as an executable, just double click it and it should work with JRE 1.8.0_11 and later.

  Alternatively, you may run the JAR file in your terminal like any other JAR file:
  java -jar ExtendedEuclideanVisual.jar

  For a detailed example of how to compute the GCD and modular inverse by hand, see Examples.jpg
